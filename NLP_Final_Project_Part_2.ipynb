        "\n",
        "####Embedding Layer: The model begins with an embedding layer, which transforms each word-index in the input sequences into a dense vector of fixed size. This is a crucial step as it allows the model to learn a rich representation for each word.\n",
        "####LSTM Layers: Next are two LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers. LSTM, a form of recurrent neural network (RNN), is adept at processing sequences and capturing temporal dependencies. This is essential for text generation, where the meaning and structure depend heavily on the order of words.\n",
        "####Dropout Layer: A dropout layer follows, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a portion of the input units to zero during training.\n",
        "####Dense Layer with Softmax Activation: The final layer is a dense (fully connected) layer with softmax activation. It outputs a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next word in the sequence.\n",
        "####2. Training Process:\n",
        "####Data Preparation: The training data is prepared by creating sequences from the tokenized script. Each input sequence is padded to a fixed length and used to predict the next word in the sequence.\n",
        "####One-Hot Encoding: The output words (labels) are one-hot encoded, turning them into a format suitable for categorical prediction.\n",
        "####Model Compilation: The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer, a combination well-suited for classification tasks.\n",
        "####3. Text Generation:\n",
        "####Generating New Text: Once trained, the model can generate new text. Starting with a seed sequence, the model predicts the next word, which is then appended to the sequence. This new sequence is fed back into the model for the next prediction. This process repeats, generating a chain of text.\n",
        "####Handling Sequences: The model continuously updates the input sequence by adding new predictions and trimming to maintain the fixed length.\n",
        "####Probabilistic Nature: Each output from the model represents a probability distribution over the possible next words, allowing for diverse and contextually relevant text generation.\n",
        "####4. Application:\n",
        "####This functionality is particularly exciting for creative applications like:\n",
        "\n",
        "####Automated Script Writing: Generating new script content that aligns with the style and themes of the input script.\n",
        "####Predictive Text Generation: Offering suggestions for scriptwriters based on the current context of their writing.\n",
        "####5. Significance:\n",
        "####The significance of this model lies in its ability to learn and mimic the linguistic patterns, style, and narrative flow of the input script, providing a tool that can assist in creative writing or even generate entirely new content based on learned patterns. It represents a blend of machine learning and creative writing, pushing the boundaries of how AI can be used in artistic and creative domains.\n",
